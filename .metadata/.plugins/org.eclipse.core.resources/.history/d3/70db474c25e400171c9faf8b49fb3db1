Agenda
If you are unable to run the program, there are a few steps you might have to take.
Sorry.

First, you will get a security error, saying the application is by an unidentified developer.
Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General. Then run the program. 
You should see a message notifying you of the program in System Preferences and a button saying "Run Anyway"
Click "Run Anyway," and the program should run properly. 

Second, if you get an error saying you need a JDK environment, go to Self Service > Updates and download Java_8U144.
If you have Eclipse, this is not necessary. 

If you have any errors, check the log (in the folder that you chose) and look through the messages. 

email me with any questions, errors, and log lines at varanoth@pascack.org
