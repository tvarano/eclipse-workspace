 * 7)  PRACTICE - CODING WITH ARRAYS

     Use Eclipse to complete the following in a class called ArrayTester.

        A)  Create an array called nums that will have a length of 20 integer elements.

        B)  Initialize each element in nums to a random integer from 0 to 100.                   

        C)  Write a method to output the values in the array... then call the method.

        D)  Write the following static methods that use the nums array as a parameter:

             a) sum… returns the sum of the values in the array.

             b) average… returns the average of the values in the array.

             c) min… returns the smallest number in the array.

             d) max… returns the largest number in the array.

             e) countX… Also accepts an integer parameter called key and returns a count of the number of times key is found in the array.

              f) reverse… Reverse the order of the elements in the array.
                            Implement this by swapping first and last, etc.

             g)  findPosition… Also accepts an integer parameter called key and returns the first index in which key is found. Return –1 if the array does not contain key.
